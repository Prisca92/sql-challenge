# sql-challenge
In this repository I was able to conduct research about people whom the fictional cpmpany employoyed during the 1980 and 1990's.
I was given six csv files and I created tables to hold these csv files to perform Data Modeling, some data engineering and Data analysis.
First, I inspected the csv files and skecthed out an EDR using quick data base. I then imported this file into my sql and used this to create table schemas and queries.
These schemas and queries were then used to help me answer the questions at hand to make an analysis based on the data provdied. 
In this repository you will be able to locate the files that will show the data modeling with an ERD file, engeneeing and analysis.
